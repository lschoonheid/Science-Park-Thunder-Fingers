Genetic algorithm:
This is the algorithm that is advised by almost everyone when looking up this problem. 
You make a few schedules and give points for how good the schedule is and then combines (crossover) the best schedule to make new ones. 
This is an easy way to quickly get to a good type of schedule.

Interval scheduling:
Algorithm in which you make sure no tasks overlap (might nog be the best chose because our tasks don't have a set time (yet) which is the case in most of the examples of this type of algorithm
