# Individual Part by Laszlo

### Idea's:

- Performance optimization/profiling
  - Compression of data to save memory
  - caching prototype generation
  - Building indices on data already tried
  - loop vs draw recursive (recursive draw = faster due to expensive `random.shuffle` vs `random.choice`)
  - Multiprocessing
  - cProfile tests for each of the above
- Graph visualization
  - Fixed filter js part from pyvis
- Genetic algorithm?
- Breadth first/depth first iteration
- sudoku algorithm for coloring graph
- Hillclimber algorithm

### Questions

- Allowed to mention commits that happened before submission of individual part plan?
